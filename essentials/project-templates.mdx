## AI-Powered Scaffolding

### Intelligent Code Generation

CodinIT's AI can generate entire project structures based on natural language descriptions:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Describe Your Project">
    Tell CodinIT what you want to build in natural language

    ```
    "Create a blog application with user authentication,
    post creation, and commenting system"
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="AI Analyzes Requirements">
    CodinIT's AI understands your requirements and suggests:
    - Optimal tech stack
    - Database schema
    - Project structure
    - Required dependencies
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate & Customize">
    Review the suggested structure and make adjustments before generation
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start Coding">
    Your project is ready with all boilerplate code, configurations, and best practices in place
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Custom Templates

### Creating Your Own Templates

You can save your project structures as custom templates for reuse:

1. **Open Project Settings** in an existing project
2. **Select "Save as Template"**
3. **Configure template metadata**:
   - Template name
   - Description
   - Category
   - Required dependencies
4. **Share with your team** or keep it private

<Tip>
Custom templates are perfect for maintaining consistency across projects in your organization.
