    ### What Works in JetBrains

    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="âœ… All Core Features" defaultOpen>
        - Diff editing and file modifications
        - Multiple API providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, local models)
        - MCP servers and custom tools
        - Codinit rules and workflows
        - @ mentions for files, folders, and problems

      <Accordion title="ðŸ“‹ Terminal Integration Difference">
        **JetBrains shows terminal output differently than VS Code:**
        - VS Code: Output streams directly to chat
        - JetBrains: Output appears in collapsible "Command Output" sections
        
        Commands execute successfully in bothâ€”just expand the section to see results in JetBrains.
