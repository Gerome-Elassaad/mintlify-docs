## Best Practices

### 🔐 Security Considerations

<Warning>
  Never commit sensitive information like API keys, passwords, or tokens to Git repositories.
</Warning>

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Token Management" icon="key">
    Use personal access tokens instead of passwords for Git authentication.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Repository Permissions" icon="shield">
    Configure appropriate repository permissions and branch protection rules.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Secret Scanning" icon="search">
    Enable GitHub/GitLab secret scanning to detect accidentally committed secrets.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Access Control" icon="users">
    Regularly audit repository access and remove inactive collaborators.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Workflow Optimization

<Steps>
  <Step title="Establish Branch Strategy">
    Define clear branching conventions (Git Flow, GitHub Flow, or custom strategy).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Up Branch Protection">
    Protect main/production branches with required status checks and reviews.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure CI/CD">
    Set up automated testing and deployment for all branches.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use Meaningful Commit Messages">
    Write clear, descriptive commit messages that explain the purpose of changes.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Regular Maintenance">
    Clean up merged branches, update dependencies, and archive old repositories.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### 📝 Commit Conventions

<Tip>
  Use conventional commit messages to automate versioning and changelog generation.
</Tip>

<CodeGroup>

```bash Conventional Commits
# Feature commits
feat: add user authentication system
feat: implement dark mode toggle

# Bug fixes
fix: resolve navigation menu overflow
fix: correct API endpoint response format

# Documentation
docs: update installation instructions
docs: add API reference documentation

# Refactoring
refactor: optimize database queries
refactor: improve component structure

# Performance improvements
perf: reduce bundle size by 40%
perf: optimize image loading

# Chore/maintenance
chore: update dependencies
chore: configure ESLint rules
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Git Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Authentication Errors">
    **Problem**: Git operations fail with authentication errors.

    **Solutions**:

    - Verify your personal access token is valid and not expired
    - Check token permissions for the target repository
    - Ensure token has appropriate scopes for the operation
    - Try regenerating the token if issues persist
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Repository Access Issues">
    **Problem**: Cannot access private repositories or perform operations.

    **Solutions**:

    - Verify repository permissions and access level
    - Check if the repository exists and is spelled correctly
    - Ensure your token has the required permissions
    - Contact repository administrator for access if needed
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Push/Pull Errors">
    **Problem**: Push or pull operations fail with merge conflicts or errors.

    **Solutions**:

    - Pull latest changes before pushing to avoid conflicts
    - Resolve any merge conflicts locally before pushing
    - Check branch permissions and protection rules
    - Verify remote repository URL is correct
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Large Repository Issues">
    **Problem**: Repository cloning or operations fail with large repositories.

    **Solutions**:

    - Clone specific branches instead of entire repository
    - Use shallow clone for faster initial cloning
    - Check repository size and consider using Git LFS for large files
    - Contact repository maintainer for access optimization
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
