## AI Provider Issues

### API Key Problems

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="key" title="Invalid API key errors">
    **Problem**: Getting "Invalid API key" or "Authentication failed" errors.

    **Solutions**:
    1. **Check API key format**: Ensure you're copying the complete key from your provider dashboard
    2. **Verify key permissions**: Some providers require specific permissions for API access
    3. **Check key expiration**: Some keys have expiration dates or usage limits
    4. **Test in provider dashboard**: Verify your key works directly with the provider

    **Provider-specific tips**:
    - **OpenAI**: Keys start with `sk-` and are found in [API Keys section](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
    - **Anthropic**: Keys start with `sk-ant-` and require console access
    - **Google**: Keys are 39 characters and need Gemini API enabled

    <Warning>Never share your API keys publicly or commit them to version control.</Warning>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="credit-card" title="Rate limit exceeded">
    **Problem**: Hitting API rate limits or quota exceeded errors.

    **Solutions**:
    1. **Check your usage**: Monitor your account usage in the provider dashboard
    2. **Upgrade your plan**: Consider a higher-tier plan for more usage
    3. **Implement retry logic**: Add delays between API calls
    4. **Switch providers**: Use alternative providers when one hits limits
    5. **Use local models**: Consider Ollama for unlimited local inference
